# VakyaSaar: A Marathi Text Summarizer
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
A modern web app that provides a ChatGPT-like experience for Marathi text summarization. Built with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS and powered by the OpenAI API.

Clean, responsive UI inspired by the OpenAI Chat/Playground UX
Customizable model selection, conversation history, and chat settings
Theming support (light/dark) and easy CSS variable overrides
Extensible: add custom prompts, file uploads, or new model integrations
## Goals
* Provide the same features as [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
[OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat).
* Use a modern web stack of React, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript.

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for details.
